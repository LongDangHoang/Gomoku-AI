# This is a simple attempt at a Gomoku (m-n-k) game AI, using minimax algorithm.
While some optimizations are added, this project is simply for personal practice with python and recursive algorithm.

Run the game by running the file tic_tac_toe.py using the python interpreter in the command line.
Enter values as prompted, and play.

Click the board once a player wins to close the game.
